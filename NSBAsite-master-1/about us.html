            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            
            <img class="about" src="images/ourmission.jpg" alt="taking-notes">
            
            <p>Our mission is to improve the quality of the small business communities on the North Shore of Lake Washington by enabling individuals and businesses to do more and thrive. To achieve this mission we are helping entrepreneurs and small businesses pursue a strategy that delivers sustainable performance through innovation and the expanding creation and delivery of value.</p>
            
            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            
            <img class="about" src="images/Exec-Coach.jpg" alt="coaching">
            
            <p>The North Shore Business Alliance aggregates, coordinates, promotes and facilitates the delivery of developmental services to potential and current small business owners. As an aggregator we build connections and complimentary relationships with every public agency and provider of service to small business in the region. As a retailer, we focus our marketing efforts on promoting awareness, access and availability of these services to the economic community on the North Shore of Lake Washington.</p>
            
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            
            <img class="about" src="images/history.jpg">
            
            <p>The seeds that would become the North Shore Business Alliance were planted back to early 1980. After serving in the US Navy, our founder attempted to start a small restaurant in Seattle. While the venture quickly failed, the lessons learned and the experience of working with the Small Business Administration and SCORE eventually led to organizing business students to help entrepreneurs write business plans.</p>
            
            <p>This exposure to dozens of small business would ignite a passion that would lead to series of events including earning the first of six business related degrees. He would eventually become a business broker, a management consultant, a business teacher and a SCORE mentor. He would serve as a volunteer mentor in the Entrepreneurship Center at the Albers School of Business and Economics at Seattle University for 15 years.</p>
            
            <p>During this span of close to forty years, the number of federal, state and local agencies focused on helping entrepreneurs, as well as non-profit providers helping small businesses would also grow significantly. Unfortunately, the impact to reducing small business failures has not been realized. It is the culmination of this history that has fostered the deeply held belief that small business is the economic foundation of every community.</p>

            <h2>Our Executive Team</h2>
            
            <p>The day to day operations of the North Shore Business Alliance are managed by a team of people who are really passionate about small business. The Executive Director is responsible for the leadership and management of the organization and is assisted by the executive team.</p>
            
            <h2>Our Board of Directors</h2>
            
            <p>Responsible for the long term direction and the system of corporate governance, the North Shore Business Alliance Board of Directors is ultimately accountable for the activities, strategy, and financial performance of the organization.</p>
